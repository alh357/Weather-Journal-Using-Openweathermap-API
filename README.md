# Weather Journal Web Page

I use use the OpenWeatherMap API as instructed by tutor. Server.js fetches the data from the API and sends it to App.js.

- Enter a city name and a note and it will display them in a card/log along with the weather info in the city.
- Previous logs will also be displayed.
- to delete a log, click on the 'x' on the top right corner of the log.
- The server does not crash if there is a spelling or network issue.
